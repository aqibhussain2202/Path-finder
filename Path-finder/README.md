# Pathfinder
This project is visual representation of a pathfinder. Create mazes, adjust your start and end node positions and select the pathfinder you want. This application currently supports Dijkstra's, A Star, and Depth First Search.

# What I Learned
1. How to create mazes using recursive division
2. Leveraging components in ReactJS to build out a front end application
3. Responsive CSS grid designs

# Difficulties Experienced
1. It was complicated developing alogrithms that were fast and performant
2. Animating and stlying nodes on the grid
