Path Finder
Overview
This application is a pathfinding visualizer built using React and SCSS. It allows users to visualize the process of finding the shortest path between two points on a grid using various pathfinding algorithms.

Features
Visualization of A* search, Dijkstra's algorithm, and depth-first search.
Customizable grid size.
Start and end point placement.
Wall creation to obstruct paths.
Animation speed control.
